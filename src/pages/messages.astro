The main man!
Let me begin from the very beginning and tell a tale that tattles of the triumphant.
The one of the Legend that carried between hsi should blades a heart that bleed love.
He began on the day of love and spoke forth this truth into the world.
We encountered him on a acold summer day and knew no one could compare.
His soft spoken ways and large heart were beautiful to behold. His day has come once again and
this ode is in his honour.
For what do you give to a man who has everything?a
Nothing, but the purest expressino of admiration.
A brotherhood that surpasses all trepidation.
So today, let us celebrate, Our Main Man.
Not with gifts, but with out hearts.
For to the man who has everything,
We offer our deepest honour.
The essence of the love he imparts.
Happy Birthday to the one so rare,
On Valentine's Day, you sine with flair.
A friend, a guide, a brother in arms.
Extremely cherished, our main man.

But one thing I want you to be is happy, fulfilled and achieve all your goals in life. It is kinda funny how I made an impulsive decision and that was the best decision I have ever made. I am so happy to have you in my life, Happy birthday once again. I love you so much.`,

Your name now signifies a position in my life that no one can fill.
Like the duke of Ediburough or The Hamilton of Scotland. "The Skrote" 😈
You are the skrote and no one can take that away from me 🤣. Seriously though, I met you, a talkative in 200 Level and
boy has my life changed so much since then. I have gotten to know you, we have wined and dined together, be depressed together (why??) 🤣, be happy toether, be worried together. You give freely without holding back and to be honest when we were discussing, it was kind of difficult to come to a conclusion on what to get you. I can't even say thank you because thank you would be easy a label for the value you add to my life. Whatever it is that holds us togethera, it's there for life man. I no fit dey cry now o. I get steeze to maintain 😂.
I wish you every good thing life has to offer. Every single one of it, you are worth more.

Cheers to a viking.`,
